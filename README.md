# Employee Summary CLI application

The author has created a reliable Node Command Line Interface (CLI) that takes in employee information and then generates a readable HTML webpage. The webpage will display the summaries that were inputed for each employee.




This command line application will prompt users for information about current/potential employees & interns. It's able to take in as many team members your heart desires. Once you're done assembling your team, an HTML file will be created and it will diplay your information in a professional, formatted fashion. This application has also been tested to ensure all unit tests pass.
